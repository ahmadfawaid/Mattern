## About Mattern
Mattern is a serif typeface that was originally designed for headlines, yet it performs well in long text. While it’s based on _Libre Baskerville_ by [Impallari](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Baskerville), all of Mattern’s glyphs were redrawn from scratch—with a lower x-height, sharper serif tails, and carefully refined proportions, weight, and curves.

The name Mattern comes from "matter" and "pattern". Every detail matters and was carefully crafted to create consistent patterns for comfortable reading.
